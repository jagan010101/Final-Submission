One really interesting feature that is not very obvious when browsing through the app is that there are scheduled tasks which create an excel sheet of all the meals booked (Veg and Non Veg) at the cutoff time (00:00 for Breakfast, 10:00 for Lunch, 14:00 for Snacks and 17:00 for Dinner) and automatically attaches it to an email and sends it to our personal email for now but to the dining team in future if it gets to implementation stage.

We have many validations and small details everywhere in our app. We wil explain all those in our presentation.
